    <h1>ðŸŽ‰ Happy Birthday, Aunt Ani! ðŸŽ‰</h1>
    <p>
      To my dearest Auntie,<br><br>
      On this special day, I just want to take a moment to celebrate the incredible person you are. Your kindness, warmth, and the love you share with everyone around you make this world a better place. You have been my constant source of inspiration, my safe place, and the one who always knows how to brighten up my day. <br><br>
      Youâ€™re not just family to meâ€”youâ€™re a best friend, a mentor, and a role model. Your laughter and strength light up every room, and I'm so grateful for all the memories we've shared. I truly hope your birthday is filled with as much joy as you bring to all of us. You deserve all the love, happiness, and cake in the world!<br><br>
      Happy Birthday, Auntie. I love you endlessly!
    </p>
